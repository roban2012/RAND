David C. Gompert<br><br>

The idea for this book originated during research done by the author and Phil Saunders of the National Defense University on the mutual strategic vulnerabilities of China and the United States. That work, which culminated in The Paradox of Power: Sino-American Strategic Restraint 克制 in an Era of Vulnerability (National Defense University Press, 2012), proposed measures the two powers could take to reduce the dangers of conflict in the nuclear, anti-satellite, and cyber-war domains. But it left dangling 悬挂 one problem, arguably as important: the maritime domain―in particular, the looming 隐隐约约的；正在逼近的 competition and potential confrontation between Chinese and American sea power in the Western Pacific and adjacent 近海 seas.<br><br>


Just as that region has entered a period of change, owing to China’s expanding power, so is the nature of sea power changing. As a consequence, great uncertainty surrounds the question of who will control these vital waters―a question of importance for the United States, China, the rest of the region, and the world. With global economic integration, reliance on sea-borne 海上运输 trade and sea-based resources is growing. So is interest in cooperative maritime security, an idea advanced by the world’s leading naval power, the United States. At the same time, technology is increasing the vulnerability of naval vessels and shipping on the oceans’ surface. If the latter development means that the maritime domain 领海权 may become less secure, the former development suggests an alternative to maritime competition and confrontation. Indeed, the rush of technology could push rivals at sea to become partners at sea instead.<br><br>

With regard to both developments, the future relationship between American and Chinese sea power―in classical terms, the “established power” and the “rising power”―is central, especially in East Asian waters. This study explores that relationship along several dimensions: theoretical, historical, economic, geo-political, and technological. It does so from the standpoint of U.S. interests, though with an eye on Chinese and other foreign interests. The imperative 必要的 of maritime security and the challenge of vulnerability are not unique to the United States or to the Western Pacific. However, it is on U.S. interests in the Western Pacific that changes in sea power may have their first big effects.<br><br>

This study comes at a time of heightened recognition of the importance of this region to the world and to the United States. Its findings should be of interest to policymakers, opinion makers, practitioners, and scholars involved in any aspect of Sino-American relations, Asian affairs, naval and maritime questions, or political-military issues in general. While the issues are complex, the author has tried to present them in an accessible way.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T2">Foreword</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
by James Dobbins<br><br>

Referring to how “those far distant, storm-beaten ships, upon which the Grand Army never looked, stood between it and the dominion 统治 of the world,” Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan both described Britain’s successful blockade of Napoleonic France and sought thereby to persuade Americans that their own nation’s manifest destiny should not stop at the water’s edge. Mahan’s massively 大量 popular The Influence of Sea Power upon History was signally successful in so doing, becoming part of the intellectual backdrop 背景 to America’s acquisition of Caribbean and Far Eastern colonies and the construction of a world-class battle fleet.<br><br>

Unfortunately, Mahan’s thesis also impressed many influential Germans and Japanese. Their aspirations 强烈的愿望 were dashed 猛冲 at Jutland 日德兰半岛 and Midway 中途岛. The last of these battles gave the United States unchallenged mastery 优势 of the world’s oceans, a position it continues to occupy 70 years later.<br><br>

Today, China is emerging as a potential competitor. In this volume, David Gompert asks what these earlier contests can tell us about that which is now on the horizon. History teaches many lessons. The difficulty is picking the right one. Well aware of this, David offers herein reflections on three encounters between rising and declining sea powers. Two of these ended in war, that between Germany and the United Kingdom in 1914 德国打英国 and between Japan and the United States in 1941 日本打美国. The third, that between the United Kingdom and the United States 美国和英国, led to a gradual and largely amicable 友善 transfer of first regional and then global predominance 优势 from one navy to the other.<br><br>

None of these outcomes is particularly appealing 吸引人的, as David Gompert’s analysis makes clear. Must America ultimately fight for or cede 放弃/割让 its naval primacy 首位? If one projects recent Chinese and American economic growth rates several decades into the future, it becomes hard to envisage 正视/想象 how one outcome or the other can be avoided. How long would an otherwise preeminent 卓越 China be content to see a smaller, poorer, less powerful rival dominate the world’s sea-lanes 航道? How long would an otherwise weaker America wish to guard global trade routes for China’s trade at America’s expense 损失? These are the questions with which this important study grapples 抓住/格斗.
<br><br>

Of course, China may not continue growing faster than America. After all, Japan did not. Even if China does, will it inevitably choose to challenge America’s maritime superiority?<br><br>


Maritime competition between the United States and China is already being shaped by new cyber, space, and other technologies of which Admirals Nelson, von Tirpitz, and Yamamoto （山本五十六） never dreamed. The geo-political and geo-economic environment in which this competition is waged has also evolved. Never in human history have the benefits of peace, in terms of rapidly improving material well-being, been so great, nor the consequences of war, in terms of nuclear devastation 毁灭, been so catastrophic 灾难. As a result, interstate conflict has become exceedingly rare 少. Indeed, no two major powers have gone to war with each other in more than half a century. Great nations still compete for power, influence, and wealth （财富、名誉、权力，One Piece）, but do so upon a somewhat different set of assumptions about the risks of conflict and the rewards of cooperation.<br><br>

For these reasons, it would be imprudent 草率 to assume that Sino-American naval rivalry must end like any of those cited in this volume. It would be equally imprudent, however, to assume otherwise, as this study makes clear. The past may not chart the future 历史不确定未来, but it’s the only map we have. Maritime competition with China will almost certainly increase over the coming years. At the very least, China will challenge American dominance of the seas immediately adjacent 临近 to it. David Gompert illuminates 阐释 herein the prospects for that contest in the light of current and future capabilities, existing American and Chinese strategies, and the prior experience of such great-power rivalries.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T3">Summary</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
	
American power in the Western Pacific has been, is, and will remain largely defined by sea power. Yet China views nearby U.S. sea power as a menacing presence, a counterweight to its regional interests, and a potential barrier to its access to the world’s oceans, resources, and markets. It is therefore deploying anti-ship missiles, submarines, and other capabilities that threaten the U.S. surface fleet. China is also expanding its own naval forces in East Asian waters to back its territorial claims, secure its trade approaches, and extend its influence. Because this vital region could become unstable or fall under China’s sway if U.S. sea power recedes or is allowed to become vulnerable, the United States can be expected to react to this challenge. Thus, a classic case of an established sea power resisting a rising one is shaping up in the Western Pacific.<br><br>



Such rivalries have a way of ending up in confrontation and war. Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840C1914), widely recognized as the father of sea-power theory, held that a world power needs overseas access to raw materials and markets to expand its production beyond its consumption and thus grow stronger. Observing how Great Britain’s “outsized” Royal Navy enabled its industrial, commercial, and imperial success, he concluded that sea power is key to world power. In turn, sea power demands national―not just naval―consciousness, consensus, commitment, and stamina. As Mahan saw it, rivalry between sea powers is inherent in Darwinian world power-politics. Any sea power worth its salt must be able both to safeguard its maritime access (sea control) and, if need be, to disrupt the access of its rivals (sea denial). The core of sea power, Mahan argued, is the offensive strength of the concentrated battle fleet.<br><br>



Mahan’s ideas shaped the great sea-power rivalries of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His The Influence of Sea Power upon History was compulsory reading for German and Japanese officers, and proponents of American imperialism, notably Theodore Roosevelt, Henry Cabot Lodge, and William Randolph Hearst, appropriated his theories
to make their case. Having established continental control and developed an industrial economy, the United States turned to sea power in order to obtain possessions, achieve world power, and rid its hemisphere of foreign presence.<br><br>

中国领土到底有哪些？<a href= "pic09.html">中华民国全图</a>，到底如何？<br><br>

Great Britain, the dominant sea power of the time, chose not to oppose U.S. sea power because it faced more severe dangers elsewhere and competing demands for resources and social reform at home. Imperial Germany directly challenged British sea supremacy, which was seen as a threat to its overseas access and an impediment to becoming
a world power. London regarded the combination of Germany’s hegemonic potential in Europe and its challenge to British sea power as a strategic threat and responded by further strengthening the Royal Navy and aligning with its old enemy and Europe’s weaker power, France. Anglo-German animosity, stoked by the race to build dreadnoughts, contributed to conditions that led to World War I.<br><br>



Although sea power did not decide that war’s outcome, the pattern Mahan posited of rising powers challenging established ones resumed, now in the Pacific. Japan’s sinking of the Russian fleet in the Strait of Tsushima in 1905 had already signaled its arrival as a great, if regional, sea power. With Britain fatigued and America isolationist in the 1920s, Japan sought control of East Asian waters to acquire possessions, markets, and resources needed to sustain its own industrialization. Japan relentlessly expanded its navy, built a formidable force of aircraft carriers, and honed the skills of its skippers and sailors. Belatedly, the United States responded by increasing and deploying its fleet forward in the 1930s, threatening the lifelines on which Japan depended to pursue conquests and expand its war-making capacity. Japan felt compelled to attack Pearl Harbor. America’s industrial might and superior sea power, Mahan argued, is the offensive strength of the concentrated battle fleet.<br><br>

Belatedly, the United States responded by increasing and deploying its fleet forward in the 1930s, threatening the lifelines on which Japan depended to pursue conquests and expand its war-making capacity. Japan felt compelled to attack Pearl Harbor. America’s industrial might and superior are also collaborating with U.S. and other navies to combat piracy off Africa’s east coast; but such modest endeavors, far from the Western Pacific, in no way imply Chinese acceptance of U.S. naval strike forces near China. Of greatest concern, the Chinese are exploiting information technology―for sensing, networking, and guiding platforms and weapons―to improve and extend their targeting of surface ships with missiles, submarines, and cyber weapons. (In contrast, Chinese aircraft carriers will present a negligible threat to the U.S. fleet and be quite vulnerable.) While the Chinese are presently concentrating on such anti-naval―essentially sea-denial―capabilities, these onstitute sea power no less than traditional surface naval forces do. Sea power, after all, is not power upon the sea but power of the sea―a distinction Mahan did not make in his world of battleships and gunnery. Defending surface fleets against extended-range missiles and quiet submarines is difficult, expensive, and of diminishing utility in the face of China’s accelerating anti-naval build-up. With technologies at hand, neither ballistic missile defense nor anti-submarine warfare can keep up with the offensive enhancements of a large, capable, and resolute rival. Because of their strike capabilities and importance in U.S. military intervention in East Asia, U.S. aircraft carriers are in the crosshairs of Chinese strategy and Chinese weapons. Both Mahan’s 19th-century dictum that the key to sea power is concentrated naval force and the 20th century’s application of that dictum―the carrier― are being overtaken by 21st-century targeting and networking technology. As the battleship became vulnerable to and marginalized by the aircraft carrier by World War II, missiles and submarines will endanger the aircraft carrier and its primacy in the Western Pacific in the years to come.<br><br>

<a href= "pic08.html">Flat 3.0 Tribal Globalization</a><br><br>

The U.S. Navy, in cooperation with the U.S. Air Force, is responding to this adverse trend with preparations to counter China’s anti-naval and other anti-access capabilities, under the heading “Air- Sea Battle.” While this is an option worth having, using it would be escalatory, in that most targets are on Chinese territory. It could also be destabilizing, given that it would be most effective if employed at the very outset of a conflict, thus increasing China’s incentive to strike first and early, or even preemptively. Moreover, because Air-Sea Battle relies on computer networks for command, control, and targeting, it is exposed to Chinese cyber-attacks. It is a potentially risky military strategy on which the United States ought not to depend, and it will not solve the vulnerability problem.<br><br>




If there is a technological remedy, it lies in outflanking Chinese  targeting, figuratively speaking. Taking full advantage of networking, the United States can and should shift toward more distributed, numerous, diverse, elusive, small, long-range, and hard-to-find naval strike forces, while also exploiting two promising offensive technologies: drones and cyber-war. A more survivable U. S. strike posture along these lines would be neither escalatory nor destabilizing. Rather, by facing China with a far more complex targeting challenge, it would discourage Chinese preemptive attack, obviate the need for U.S. preemptive attack, and allow time for a crisis to be defused. Carriers will remain invaluable for the United States in other regions and will surely remain in its global fleet; but their vulnerability is becoming an operational liability in the Western Pacific. As this reality becomes apparent, the carrier’s potency in East Asian politics will also recede. Conversely, more survivable, if less conspicuous, U.S. sea power would sustain U.S. influence and interests in the region.<br><br>




Eventually, even more distributed and less visible U.S. forces may be targetable, especially with the advent of cyber-war. By that time, U.S. sea power and thus U.S. influence and war-fighting ability in the Western Pacific may be eclipsed by Chinese anti-naval and naval forces. In any case, the United States is unlikely to shift rapidly to more survivable sea power, given the long lead-times required, fiscal constraints, and institutional-industrial inertia.<br><br>



Given technological trends, an unfavorable time-line, and the fact that the United States cannot retreat from the waters of this vital region, it should also pursue a political alternative to head-to-head sea-power rivalry―one that engages its regional partners and, ideally, China itself. With the rapid expansion of sea-borne commerce and sea-based resource extraction that has accompanied globalization, the idea of collective maritime security, first championed by Admiral Mike Mullen (in 2005, when he was Chief of Naval Operations), has gained momentum in a number of regions other than East Asia. If the targeting and networking revolutions invalidate Mahan’s prescription for concentrated naval power, U.S. leadership in organizing cooperative maritime security in East Asia may invalidate his premise that sea power is necessarily adversarial. Even as the dominant sea power, the United States cannot provide sea control in every ocean, littoral, and choke-point where it is needed in today’s world. Just as the United States is capitalizing on its strength at sea to mobilize and lead others toward cooperative maritime security elsewhere, it should try to do so in the Western Pacific, where the stakes are greatest.<br><br>




More specifically, the United States should propose and pursue an East Asian maritime partnership, inviting to join all states that share its interest in assured access and passage. Such cooperation could be predicated on the norms that disputes should be settled nonviolently and that civilian shipping engaged in peaceful, peacetime trade should not be threatened. These norms could be buttressed by enhanced maritime information-sharing, crisis consultations, joint exercises and operations e.g., against non-state threats), and measures to avoid incidents. Realistically, resolving the region’s complex maritime legal disputes should not be a precondition for creating or joining the partnership; but a pledge to refrain from force in the meantime should be. Neither the United States nor China would be expected to reduce its sea-power capabilities or relinquish any of its options in the event of war. While such undertakings would not preclude naval/anti-naval competition  or conflict outright, they could reduce mistrust and mistakes of the sort that are more likely than rational forethought to trigger Sino-U.S. hostilities. <br><br>




The goal of East Asian maritime cooperation would not be to exclude China but instead to convince it to join. The participation of the region’s increasingly capable navies would encourage China to join and bolster a multilateral approach to security or else to oppose and divorce itself from a formidable naval grouping. Apart from China, a number of East Asian states are developing some of the world’s most advanced naval and anti-naval forces; while the United States and China’s oceanic neighbors should not seek to align against China, China should take care not to give them cause to do so by rejecting a cooperative arrangement. Indications that some Chinese are getting worried about regional isolation―owing to China’s growing power and assertiveness―could enable its political leaders to overrule the almost certain opposition of its military. <br><br>




Thus, the United States can at least open the door to the sort of maritime cooperation that eluded British and German statesmen before rivalry at sea became too intense to halt. It might well be that Chinese nationalism, weak civilian control of the military, and suspicion of American motives would make China’s accession unlikely, at least for now. Chinese ambivalence toward Sino-American military-tomilitary contacts over the years suggests a need for American patience and persistence. A cooperative approach to maritime security in East Asia may be a long shot and might get watered down (forgive the pun). But the advantages of an arrangement that could build familiarity and confidence while reducing dangers at sea are substantial. Moreover, as noted, the United States would not limit its capabilities or its freedom of action in the event of war. It is a high-return, low-risk idea worth trying. In parallel, technology permits the United States to transform its sea-power posture in the Western Pacific to one more survivable, operationally and politically, whether maritime cooperation ensues or not.<br><br>



In sum, the United States should move beyond dependence on concentrated surface forces while also pursuing a cooperative alternative to history’s classic reaction to a rising sea power. China and the United States have powerful reasons to avoid confrontation and the risk of war in East Asia. Because growing capabilities for sea denial may deprive both of assured sea control, the pursuit of strategic advantage at sea may leave both with diminished security at sea. The United States has technological and political options that, in tandem, can add crisis stability, lessen the intensity of sea-power rivalry, and reduce the danger of conflict, even as it shifts toward a posture that would enable it to prevail were conflict with China to occur.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T4">Sea Power and the Western Pacific: Importance, Scope, and Definition</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
	
“Command of the sea is not ‘naval.’ It is one of national policy, national security, and national obligation.” ―A. T. Mahan<br><br>


Since Commodore Matthew Perry arrived, uninvited, with a squadron of U.S. warships in Edo (now Tokyo) Bay in 1854, American Pacific power has been defined by American sea power. It was sea power that enabled the United States to assert itself in these waters and lands around them in the late 1800s. During the 20th century, U.S. fleets patrolled and, when called upon, controlled the Western Pacific, confirming that the United States has a Pacific calling to go with its Atlantic heritage. Today, with its heavy reliance on East Asian products and markets, the economic interests of the United States in the region are greater than ever. The Asia-Pacific share of total U.S. trade has risen from 5 percent in 1900 to 15 percent in 1950 to 30 percent today, larger even than U.S. trade with the rest of North America. Meanwhile, China’s rise as a great power presents the United States with both the risk of regional strife and the chance for global cooperation. As the United States recovers from its decade-long preoccupation with extremist threats in the Middle East and South Asia and turns its attention to East Asia, it is again sea power, though in forms yet unsettled, that will lend strength to the United States’ diplomacy and its ability to wage war if need be. At this juncture, it is important to assess the implications of China’s growing power, depending on how it is used, for America’s renewed interests, depending on how they are defined. Although the sea is only one of the domains in which Chinese power affects U.S. interests, it is as crucial as any, and the subject of this book.<br><br>





At times, including ours, the United States has sought and gained predominant sea power, hence sea control―defined by two prominent 20th-century proponents of sea power as “the ability to use the sea in defiance of rivals.”4 In a vast region of capable nation-states and economic vitality, where sea-borne trade is crucial, a policy of sea control can invite challenge: After all, one state’s sea control can be seen by others as a threat to their own access, i.e., sea denial.<br><br>




Because these time-weathered terms are still useful, if sometimes misunderstood, it is worth clarifying them up front. In essence, sea control is defensive, and sea denial is offensive. The former is the ability to assure continuous freedom to navigate in any and all important waters of choice. The latter is the ability or action at least temporarily to deny others access to waters considered important.5 Because the ultimate purpose of oceanic access is trade, sea control, strictly speaking, is meant to protect shipping, and sea denial is meant to menace it. For our purposes, control includes being able safely to operate one’s navy where one wishes, and denial includes being able to endanger and disrupt such naval operations.<br><br>




Sea control is not the mirror image of sea denial. It is theoretically possible, if practically unlikely, to have sea control without being able to exercise sea denial―to enjoy yet not be able to prevent access.<br><br>

Factors of Sea Power<br><br>
Sea power is the product of economics, politics, technology, and geography: necessitated by economics, textured by politics, enabled by technology, and shaped by geography. From international economics comes the need to transit the oceans safely and predictably. From international politics come confrontations and hostilities that may prompt nations to interfere with other nations’ sea-borne trade, giving rise to the need for navies.2 Domestic politics allow naval officers, business interests, and politicians to advocate, machinate, and formulate the particulars of sea power. Technology, defined to include the skill and ingenuity of people, can determine the balance between offense and defense, as well as the capabilities that afford the greatest operational advantages. If technology is equally accessible, the amount of resources a nation commits to naval capabilities determines its sea power. Geography, while largely beyond the control of nations, can make them more or less vulnerable and more or less able to project sea power where needed.<br><br>

Sea-power theory is about how these factors combine in competition and conflict. It was born of the great-power naval competitions of the 19th century and earlier, and in turn it influenced 20th-century war and peace.

The extent and effects of such change are the underlying analytic questions of this book. Global economic integration has greatly expanded international trade and investment across regions, making sea transport more important. In addition to commerce, the seas have become more coveted and contested because of raw materials beneath them and thus the question of who owns or controls them.

Sea Power Then and Now<br><br>


The concept of sea power gained both definition and prominence as the West’s colonial powers began to industrialize in the second half of the 19th century. Control of and access to empires was thought by many to become more critical as Britain, France, Germany and others developed manufacturing and built railroads, creating a hunger for fuels, ores, and other materials.4 In turn, these European states came to rely heavily on overseas markets for their manufactures, which allowed domestic production to exceed domestic demand, thus spurring growth. Broadly speaking, world economic development was ignited by industrialization and international commerce (and has continued since, except for world war and depression). It is estimated that global per capita gross domestic product (GDP) grew negligibly from the 11th century until the midC19th century, then grew by 300 percent by the end of the 19th century, then by 900 percent during the 20th century.5 Thus, the most significant progress in human material conditions has coincided with expanded use of the world’s water “highways,” as Mahan called them. With industrialization, oceanic trade graduated from spices and vices to goods and resources essential to economic success. With its natural blessings, under-utilized geographic expanse, swelling immigration and population, and growing domestic demand, the United States was later than the European powers to develop the need for resources, markets, or a strong navy.<br><br>



Despite growing trade among them, the European powers were naval competitors. Size mattered: both of multi-ocean fleets and of the economies needed to build, maintain, and operate them. The Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain could no longer keep pace with Great Britain and France, and their possessions shrank correspondingly. In contrast, newly unified Germany could catch up and keep up, and its possessions expanded correspondingly. Industrialization enabled those still in the game to construct larger, faster, and less sinkable steel-armored ships propelled by steam power and equipped with increasingly accurate long-range guns. Great Britain―first to industrialize, with the largest empire and greatest dependence on imports and markets―led in naval capabilities, which motivated old adversaries France and the United States and future adversary Germany to follow suit. Emerging from isolation, undergoing rapid industrialization, and in growing need of materials and markets, Japan was close behind.<br><br>


It was at this time that American naval officer, professor, and strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan offered lessons, theories, requirements, and implications of sea power. His fame and impact came as the United States turned its attention from postCCivil War recovery and continental expansion to global potential. Mahan’s political champions had conquests and empire in their sights.6 More than that, they wanted war: if not with Britain (disliked by them but strong) then with Spain (disliked and weak). While Mahan did not share their martial gusto, he was as unabashed as they in believing that the United States could and must become a world power. Mahan formulated in writings and teachings (and Roosevelt then retailed in corridors of power) the idea that the key to greatness, fortune, empire, and military success was sea power. In essence, sea power was both a prerequisite and a manifestation of national greatness, as Great Britain demonstrated in Mahan’s world.<br><br>



American sea power, thus world power, was but a gleam in Mahan’s eye when he began his work (1884). His theories were informed by his reading of history from Roman to modern times, but rooted deeply in the 19th century’s prime example: the Royal Navy and its indispensable role in enabling Britain’s new economic model and commanding its empire. In the words of Robert Massie:<br><br>


The Victorian Age, Pax Britannica, Splendid Isolation, the Empire on Which the Sun Never Sets, existed because “Britannia Ruled the Waves.” Essentially, she ruled unchallenged. Former antagonists, the Spanish and the Dutch, had no navies to speak of; Russia and the United States were deeply engaged in consolidating control over their own landmasses; the German Empire did not exist.<br><br>




Although its old enemy, France, had the world’s second largest fleet, “Great Britain’s naval supremacy remained unshaken.” Mahan’s theory flowed from his observation that the 19th century’s greatest power was its greatest sea power. What Great Britain had practiced, Mahan articulated: Because sea power can deliver national economic success and strategic advantage, it warrants the national commitment that it requires. In the British case, growing commercial and financial strength “enabled the country to adequately fund outsized naval fleets, and those fleets protected the trade and achieved the victories that enabled the British economy to flourish.” Mahan noticed that Britain had peers (France, for instance) in all categories of power save one: sea power. It was their superiority at sea that enabled the British to excel in exploiting industrial technology, in expanding production (well beyond domestic demand), and in securing access to the world’s abundance of raw materials. This implied that sea power was the sine qua non for world power and strategic advantage. Indeed, Britain’s navy made it the superpower of the 19th century. Knowing this, British leaders built and followed a national strategy based on sea power, and they saw to it that the Royal Navy would get the resources it needed to remain supreme.<br><br>



To Mahan, the heart of sea power was the offensive potency of a concentrated fleet. This was consistent with his belief that the “first principle of warfare is concentration―drawing force together at the centers which for the moment are important.”9 But his concept was much larger than concentrated offensive naval power, encompassing geography, navigation, economics, demographics, culture, and politics. Mahan both traced and predicted how sea power influences “history,” by which he meant the rise and fall of powers, the gain and loss of possessions, the ability to rule in peace, and the means to prevail in war. His line of thinking went like this:<br><br>



 To succeed economically and grow strong strategically, a nation needs to industrialize and produce more than it consumes.  Production requires more raw materials than the nation has.  Trade―importing materials and exporting products―is therefore vital to national economic success.<br><br>



 The oceans are the great highways of that trade.<br><br>


 Use of the oceans is vital to any nation that relies on trade and aspires to succeed economically and strategically.  The ability of a state to protect this use and to deny its enemy of it can determine the outcome of wars,  competition over power, and international standing.<br><br>



 While sea power is important for any state, it is crucial for those with the potential and goal to become world powers.  The most effective measure in war at sea is to sever the enemy’s sea lines of communication.<br><br>


 The ability to destroy the enemy’s fleet is crucial to assure this is achievable and should be the main goal of war.<br><br>


 Offense is dominant; given offensive dominance, defense is needed only to enable offense.<br><br>

 Speed is important, but not as important as concentrated force.<br><br>
 Distance is a problem unless mitigated by bases and allies.<br><br>
 Because battle fleets can only be defeated by battle fleets, the capabilities to control the seas are essentially the same as those to deny others such control.<br><br>
For Mahan, sea power was power upon the surface of the seas― naturally enough given the state of technology. Submarines were novelties;<br><br>
aviation was science fiction; space satellites had not been imagined.<br><br>
Because communications were line-of-sight and gunnery ranges were at most a few miles, concentrated force  ecessitated concentrated<br><br>

fleets. <br><br>

Fleets were tethered to bases, even more so when coal replaced sail. Placing one’s fleet between the enemy’s fleet and its homeland was the key to victory.10 Blockades, commerce raiding, and amphibious warfare were considered secondary to the “clash of battle fleets.” Although sea power took a specific form in his mind’s eye, Mahan’s concepts were deeper and transcendent. Again, power upon the sea was essential because it was the way to attain power over what transpires at sea. While he did not anticipate the importance of submarines or contemplate aircraft carriers, he would have had no difficulty regarding them as inputs to sea power or amending his insistence on concentrated battle fleets to accommodate them. Long-range landbased anti-ship missiles would have been a greater shock to Mahan’s thinking; but in the end, he would have admitted that they were part of the sea-power equation because they could visit offensive force upon navies and shipping. Even cyber-war can be fit into the purposes and essence of sea power as defined by Mahan. Looking back, the battleship formation expressed but did not define the concept of sea power. Looking ahead, naval forces will hardly be the only way to acquire and use sea power.<br><br>




Mahan’s work was both descriptive and prescriptive: He sought to persuade his own country’s powers-that-be to commit to become the sea power that its size, location, ambitions, and seafaring ways implied it could be. He did battle not only with American apathy toward sea power but also with the idea that the fleet’s purpose was to serve as the nation’s “first line of defense”―a defense-mindedness that insulted three of his core beliefs: that the United States should be a global power, that global powers need navies less to guard their coasts than to safeguard their trade and prosperity, and that offense―the ability to disrupt another power’s trade by first destroying its fleet―was the heart of sea power. <br><br>

Upon publishing The Influence of Sea Power upon History, Mahan became hugely successful intellectually and politically―a strategic celebrity. His ideas rode a wave of national enthusiasm for world possessions, respect, and influence―based on claims of political, cultural, and racial (Anglo-Saxon) superiority, stirred by Roosevelt’s “Americanism” and formulated in Lodge’s “Large Policy.” From this moment, the U.S. Navy became synonymous with U.S. greatness (just as the Royal Navy meant British greatness). From 1890 to 1900, the U.S. fleet grew from 42 ships, of which 8 were steel and none were battleships, to 140 ships, of which 100 were steel and 8 were battleships. In that decade, the Navy steamed past the U.S. Army in political influence and public esteem.<br><br>




Roosevelt, Lodge, and Hearst favored war, not only for conquest but also to reinvigorate national spirit. Mahan demurred, arguing that deterrence is preferred to war, though it requires even greater naval predominance: “Force is never more operative than when it is known to exist but is not brandished.” On the whole―again, observing the Royal Navy during the 19th century―the greater the sea power, the less likely it had to be used. Though Mahan supported the acquisition of colonies, his stress on offense was not meant to be a call to start wars, only to destroy enemy forces if war occurred. Mahan’s concept was hijacked by others with a jingoistic fervor he did not share. Though based on British experience and motivated by American ambition, Mahan’s ideas “caused a global sensation.” In 1884, Kaiser Wilhelm wrote, “I am just now . . . devouring [The Influence of Sea Power upon History] and am trying to learn it by heart.” He had it placed in the wardroom of every ship in the German fleet. The book was required reading in Japan’s naval academy. Lodge and Roosevelt Bible.” Roosevelt, as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, leant Mahan’s ideas political force, rhetorical thunder, and generous funding. The traction of Mahan’s theory of sea power was badly weakened by World War I, which was mainly decided by land warfare (even between sea powers). The culminating Anglo-German naval battle, Jutland, ended in a tactical draw but a strategic win for Britain, which retained its mastery of the seas and consequent ability to gradually strangle the German economy and starve its population. Britain’s blockade of Germany affected the war’s course and outcome; but it also spurred development of the submarine to elude surface combatants and sink shipping. In general, World War I left losers and victors alike (except Japan) tired, broke, disinterested in more overseas possessions, and inclined to reduce, not increase, their fleets.<br><br>




It was the railroad, another product of the industrial revolution, that was seen as enabling great land powers to consolidate control, compete, move troops, and determine the outcome of war, more so than control of the seas.19 It was then that English geographer Halford Mackinder offered a competing and, considering World War I, more popular theory that land power, facilitated by rail transport, was the key to great power.20 (Ironic that an Englishman fashioned the theory of land power while an American did so for sea power.) It took war in the Pacific between Japan and the United States two decades later to revive Mahan’s theory of the importance of navies in war, peace, and
history.<br><br>




Half a century after Mahan, with the benefit of learning from the Japanese-American conflict, E. B. Potter and Admiral Chester Nimitz (retired commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet in World War II) updated Mahan’s ideas.21 Based mainly on American naval success (something unknown to Mahan), they wrote:<br><br>


The capacity of a nation to use the sea is based upon the character and numbers of its population, the character of its government, the soundness of its economy, the quality and numbers of its harbors, the extent of its coastline . . . and the location of homeland, bases, and colonies with respect to sea traffic. . . . A warring nation that has achieved a predominant capacity to use the sea is said to have command or control of the sea [which] consists of (1) the ability to defend one’s own sea communications and (2) the ability to deny the enemy the sea communications
he requires to carry on the war. . . . Bases are indispensable to naval operations for both logistic and strategic reasons . . . needed to replenish, repair and protect fleets and also to maintain them near important communications routes.<br><br>



They also incorporated naval aviation into sea power theory: aircraft carriers replacing battleships as the most important platforms; the need for fleet concentration reduced; the risk of fleet concentration increased; and “gunboat diplomacy” promoted to “carrier diplomacy” to influence friends, foes, and crises.<br><br>



Writing during the Cold War, Potter and Nimitz were also more mindful than Mahan of the value of allies in creating and using sea power, whether for basing or supplementing the U.S. Navy. NATO became the first peacetime broad-based naval (and military) alliance, and the United States both supported and relied on the naval capabilities of (once rivals) Britain and Germany, as well as others. Another historical adversary of the United States, Japan, also became an ally and naval partner, though of limited capabilities and reach. Maritime security became collaborative. To this end, U.S. leadership was as important as U.S. supremacy, though the latter obviously facilitated the former. Unlike Imperial Germany and Imperial Japan, the United States “multilateralized” sea power. At the same time, American strategy then and now requires U.S. naval power―and U.S. military power in general―to be robust enough to assure national security regardless of the strength and reliability of allies.<br><br>




With the help of its allies, U.S. sea power went essentially unchallenged during the Cold War, giving the United States the ability to assure maritime security, reinforce NATO, strike the Soviet homeland, and take on a new submarine-based strategic nuclear mission. Although the Soviets invested heavily in naval and long-range, landbased anti-naval capabilities, they were never able to threaten U.S. sea control, much less rival it. With East-West confrontation concentrated on the western and eastern edges of the Eurasian land mass, the Cold War could be described geo-politically as one between a great land power and a great sea power. If the Soviet Union ruled Mackinder’s “Heartland” and most of his “World Island,” American command of the seas, trade, economy, and defense of the sea-connected “Free World” validated Mahan’s thinking. Owing to its sea power, the geographic remoteness of the United States from key theaters of East-West confrontation proved to be more advantageous than disadvantageous. The Cold War also reinforced U.S. reliance on global force projection, much of it by sea and supported by the ability to strike from the sea. In addition to its limited ice-free, risk-free access to open oceans noted earlier, the Soviet Union’s failure, despite considerable effort, to exercise serious sea power in the North Atlantic or Western Pacific suggests a deficit of understanding, commitment, and competence to do so. The Soviet Union had negligible sea-borne trade, being isolated from the Western economy and reliant mainly on commerce with its client states, which with the exception of Cuba were land neighbors. Its main reason to build a fleet was self-protection in the event of World War III, both by holding U.S. naval strike power at a safe distance and by impeding U.S. reinforcement of NATO.22 This narrow motivation proved inadequate to make the Soviet superpower a sea power<br><br>


as well. Being a non-trading land power with a military dominated by generals, the Soviet Union lacked the commitment that made Britain, Germany, the United States, and Japan sea powers. It proved the rule that national consciousness of the importance of the seas is needed to provide the resources, patience, and persistence for navies.23 The only parts of sea power the Soviet Union possessed―ships―are of limited value absent the whole package.<br><br>




As important as ships are the skills needed to crew and command them. Referring to the officers of the Royal Navy during the 19th century, Robert Massie wrote, “Going from ship to ship as they progressed in age and rank, experienced the sea and learned to command. The ultimate lesson was constant: in the British Navy it was not the ships but the men who won.”24 The same can be said for German, American, and Japanese officers and sailors―and French, Spanish, Dutch, and Portuguese ones before them. Superior British seamanship and confidence on the high seas, whether in the English Channel or off China, were products of generations of experience, which has no substitute. Operating globally is qualitatively more demanding than operating coastally or regionally. It is also more potent because it gives the global sea power options the regional sea power does not have, such as “swinging” fleets from region to region or surging them from home bases in response to need. Both the Germans and the Japanese erred in calculating that the worldwide span of British and U.S. sea power, respectively, would be a disadvantage against regional sea power; for both Great Britain and the United States were able to bring far forces to bear when required to do so. What can distinguish the best navies from all others is the regularity with which they steam at great dis- tance, detached from their support. When coupled with two-ocean access, as the United States has, such ranges facilitate coverage of high seas, trade routes, and critical waters worldwide.<br><br>



A land power can be a sea power, as the American and German cases show. But the strategic culture of the land power may relegate its naval service to junior status and fail to attract and develop the personnel required for blue-water superiority. The Soviet Navy never matched its investment in ships with an investment in sailors. In current parlance, the Soviet Union concentrated on the “hardware” of sea power while neglecting the “software.” Whether China can master both sides of sea power is a key question to which we will return.<br><br>



These intangible qualities and the experience it takes to hone them explain why it can take decades to achieve sea control, let alone dominance, even with the industrial capacity for large-scale naval construction. Japan made a national commitment to become a sea power 60 years before Pearl Harbor, and 25 years before crushing the Russian fleet in 1905. Even with extraordinary political and industrial drive, it took Germany 30 years to confront the Royal Navy (at Jutland), and then it fell short. As rising sea powers mount such massive efforts, established ones can invest and maneuver to meet the challenge, as Britain did toward Germany and as the United States did toward Japan
and may now do toward China.<br><br>




The chapters that follow will investigate how Mahan’s propositions are withstanding technological and geo-political change, particularly the military-information revolution and globalization. But it seems that his basic explanation of sea power―answering vital national needs, enabling national greatness, reflecting national character, requiring national commitment―is valid still. As we will see, the degree of national commitment is bound to affect the prospect or at least the timing of sea-power competition between the United States and China: The Americans are at a very different point in a very long national learning curve. At the same time, in sharp contrast to the Soviet Union, China depends vitally on sea access and thus has a strong incentive. At present, that access depends on the forbearance of the U.S. sea power, which the Chinese are disinclined to assume.<br><br>


We will return to the relationship of Chinese and U.S. sea power in the next chapter, after devoting the remainder of this one to the search for relevant lessons from three historical cases, two of them involving the United States and one of them set in the Western Pacific.<br><br>
