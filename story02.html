	<hr>

西方求利，中国求名。中国一切服从政治，西方一切依靠经济。从1840年到现在，好像没变。<br><br>

American interests in the Western Pacific depend on sea power. Yet China views nearby U.S. sea power as a threat, a counterweight 平衡力 to its regional interests, and a potential barrier to its access to the world’s oceans, resources, and markets. China is expanding its sea power in East Asian waters, deploying advanced anti-ship missiles, submarines, and other capabilities that threaten the U.S. fleet. Because this vital region could become unstable or fall under China’s sway 摇摆；支配，统治 if U.S. sea power were to recede or become vulnerable, the United States will react to this challenge.<br><br>

Thus, as David C. Gompert explains in Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific, a classic case of a rising sea power challenging an established one is shaping up in East Asian waters. Such rivalry can lead to confrontation, crisis, or war. Gompert applies the sea-power theory of American naval theorist Alfred Thayer Mahan 马汉, the history of three rivalries between established and rising sea powers, and current U.S. and Chinese interests and capabilities to propose how the United States can sustain its sea power and reach a modus vivendi 暂时妥协 with China in the region.<br><br>


Key findings:<br><br>
  U.S. interests and influence in the Western Pacific depend on sea power, as they long have. Yet China regards U.S. sea power as menacing and so is expanding its own in the form of advanced anti-naval and naval capabilities.<br><br>

  This looming 隐约地出现；赫然耸现；迫在眉睫 rivalry between an established sea power and a rising one has historical precedents, two of which― Britain versus Germany and America versus Japan― ended in war.<br><br>

  To protect its interests yet avoid conflict, the United States should develop distributed, diverse, survivable forces while cooperating with its friends and, ideally, China, to manage regional maritime security.<br><br>

Mahan’s theories grew out of his observations on how Great Britain’s Royal Navy enabled its industrial, commercial, and imperial success. Mahan concluded that sea power is key to world power and requires the ability to safeguard one’s own maritime access (sea control) and to prevent such access by enemies (sea denial). Mahan’s ideas shaped the great seapower rivalries of the late 19th and early 20th centuries and were studied and applied by German and Japanese officers as well as by proponents 支持者，拥护者 of American imperialism 美帝国主义, including Theodore Roosevelt.<br><br>

如果只读两句马汉的话，请记住：<br><br>

“Command of the sea is not ‘naval.’ It is one of national policy, national security, and national obligation.” ―A. T. Mahan<br><br>

“If navies, as all agree, exist for the protection of commerce, it inevitably follows that in war they must aim at depriving their enemy of that great resource.” ―A. T. Mahan<br><br>

美国挑战英国<br><br>

The United States and Great Britain in the late 19th century provide one example of a rising sea power challenging
an established one. The United States, having established continental control and industrialized its economy, turned
to sea power in order to obtain possessions, achieve world power, and rid 摆脱 its hemisphere 半球 of foreign presence. Great Britain, then the predominant sea power, chose not to oppose growing U.S. sea power, partly because it faced more pressing challenges elsewhere and partly because of the two countries’ economic interdependence and convergence of interests, including in maritime security.<br><br>

德国挑战英国<br><br>

Great Britain avoided conflict with the United States in part because it faced another rising sea power: Imperial
Germany, which regarded British sea power as a threat to its overseas access and an impediment 妨碍，阻止 to becoming a world power. Britain regarded Germany’s hegemonic  统治，势力范围（ hegemony）；霸权主义 potential in Europe and its challenge to British sea power as a strategic threat. It responded by strengthening the Royal Navy and allying with its old enemy and Europe’s weaker power, France. The ensuing 继而产生 naval arms race and rising levels of Anglo-German animosity 憎恨 contributed to the conditions that led to World War I.<br><br>

美国挑战日本<br><br>

In a third example, Imperial Japan by the 1920s sought control of East Asian waters to acquire possessions 领地；财产, markets, and resources, so it relentlessly 无情地 expanded and modernized its navy. Belatedly 来得很迟的, the United States responded by increasing and deploying its fleet forward in the Pacific in the 1930s, posing a threat to the lifelines on which Japan depended to maintain its conquests and expand its war-making ability. Facing sea denial, Japan felt compelled to attack the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor. <br><br>

中国挑战美国<br><br>

Of the three cases, the most encouraging, obviously, is the Anglo-American one, which ended in maritime coexistence,
cooperation, and eventual alliance. The United States, however, is not about to defer 服从；延期 to China in East Asia as Britain deferred to the United States in the Western Hemisphere.<br><br>

The more worrisome and perhaps more relevant case is the Anglo-German one, which ended badly, raising the question
of why London and Berlin could not find a cooperative solution, given a common interest in maritime security.<br><br>

	<hr>

东亚有冲突<br><br>

The United States and China are economically interdependent and have convergent 趋同的 global interests, but they are at loggerheads 对立 in East Asia. While China has not embraced global sea power, it is moving from coastal defense to extending its naval reach into disputed water in order to protect regional trade routes 贸易航线（行洋）. Of most concern, the Chinese military is exploiting information technology to greatly improve and extend its targeting of surface ships, especially U.S. aircraft carriers, with missiles, submarines, and cyber weapons.<br><br>

美国不能防守<br><br>

Defending U.S. ships against extended-range missiles and quiet submarines is difficult, expensive, and probably futile 无效 in the face of China’s accelerating, well-funded antinaval build-up. With known technologies, neither ballistic missile defense nor anti-submarine warfare can keep pace with the offensive enhancements of such a large, capable, and resolute 坚决的，刚毅的 rival.<br><br>

海空一体作战<br><br>

The U.S. Navy, in cooperation with the U.S. Air Force, is responding with “Air-Sea Battle” to counter China’s antinaval and other anti-access capabilities by targeting its “kill chain” of sensors and weapons. While this is a worthwhile option, it could become vulnerable to Chinese cyber attack, might require the United States to strike first or preemptively 先发制人, and could be escalatory, in that most targets are on Chinese territory 攻击中国本土. A better approach is to take full advantage of networking technology and shift toward more distributed, numerous, diverse, elusive 难以捉摸的, small, long-range, and hard-tofind naval strike forces, while also exploiting drones 无人驾驶飞机 and cyber-war. Yet even more distributed and less visible U.S. forces may become targetable. Moreover, the U.S. Navy is unlikely to shift rapidly to such survivable sea power, given fiscal constraints and institutional-industrial inertia. Meanwhile, the vulnerability of U.S. sea power will increase, and regional stability could suffer. 美国对中国优势减少<br><br>

	<b><a name="T4">Options for Cooperation</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
	
Given technological trends, an unfavorable timeline, and the strategic importance of East Asia, the United States should also pursue a political alternative to sea-power rivalry, engaging its regional partners and, ideally, China itself in cooperative maritime security. Like the United States and other countries in East Asia, China depends vitally on the security of seaborne  海上运输的 trade, which accounts for 95 percent of its total trade and nearly 50 percent of its economy.<br><br>

中国95%的外贸和50%的经济产值<br><br>

<a href= "pic04.html">中国海军控制日本命脉</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic05.html">中国原料进口路线</a><br><br>
 


The United States should propose an East Asian maritime security partnership, inviting all states that share its
interest in assured access and passage to join. Such cooperation could be predicated on the norms that disputes should be settled nonviolently and that civilian shipping engaged in peaceful, peacetime trade should not be threatened. Realistically, resolving the region’s complex maritime legal disputes should not be a precondition for the partnership, but a pledge 保证 to refrain 避免 from force should be.<br><br>

Participation of other increasingly capable navies in the region could encourage China to join and bolster 支持 a multilateral approach to security. As China has become more powerful and assertive 独断 within the region, its neighbors have become more wary 小心 of it; fear of becoming isolated 孤立 could cause Chinese political leaders to overrule 否决 military opposition 敌对 to multilateral cooperation. While China’s participation in an East Asian maritime security partnership would not preclude 排除 naval competition or conflict, it could reduce mistrust and mistakes that might trigger Sino-U.S. hostilities.<br><br>

美国应放弃绝对优势<br><br>

In sum, the United States should reduce dependence on concentrated surface forces, such as aircraft carriers, while
pursuing a cooperative alternative to relations with the rising sea power. China and the United States have reason to avoid conflict in East Asia. Because technology is producing growing capabilities for sea denial and may deprive 剥夺 both powers of assured sea control, the pursuit of strategic advantage at sea may leave both with diminished 减弱 maritime security. The United States has technological and political options at sea that can add crisis stability, lessen the intensity of rivalry, and reduce the risk of conflict, even as it shifts toward a more survivable posture that would enable it to prevail if conflict with China occurs.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T5">The Fall of the Wall: A World Restored?</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
	
   by     Christopher S. Chivvis<br><br>

World leaders were gathering in the German capital Monday to mark 20 years since the collapse of the Berlin Wall redrew the map of Europe and brought about the end of the Cold War.<br><br>

Christopher Chivvis<br><br>
RAND Corporation<br><br>

The fall of the Berlin Wall retains its status as an epoch-making event in modern world history, even as it passes from recent into truly historical memory.<br><br>

The year 1989 ended what the historian Eric Hobsbawm dubbed 授予 the “short” 20th century. Over its course, the European states that once bestrode 骑 the world spent themselves in two world wars and were then superseded by the new superpowers of East and West, each dedicated to its own ideology, each armed with weapons of unsurpassed destructive force.<br><br>

To those raised in the shadow of possible nuclear holocaust, the chief sentiment when the Wall fell 20 years ago was disbelief 怀疑, followed by relief. Relief naturally brought hope that the end of the Cold War would bring lasting peace, and the end of conflict. And in Europe, at least, it mostly did - but not everywhere.<br><br>

At the time, not a few of Germany’s erstwhile 以前 adversaries 敌人 feared that a reunited Germany would revert to the militarism of its past, that Europe’s “German problem” would be reborn. Here the pessimists were wrong. Reunited Germany opened the door to a new European order and a continent at once whole, free, and at peace.<br><br>

Was this a world restored? In some ways, yes. The great European powers of the 19th century again appeared ascendant 上升. The United States was free, after half a century, to return to its shores. Though it chose to keep troops in Europe, its focus gradually shifted elsewhere.<br><br>

By contrast with the past, however, and in part because of it, Europe’s states chose to bind themselves together in new institutional structures around a rejuvenated European Union and a reformed NATO.<br><br>

If there was peace, however, there were also the seeds of future conflict.<br><br>

Not all the states with a historical claim to great power status were embraced in the new institutional structures that developed over the next decade. Russia’s exclusion from them may have been inevitable, but it may still prove tragic if the fall of the Wall turns out to have the perverse effect of isolating Russia in its own darkening sphere.<br><br>

Meanwhile, the Balkans churned, a harbinger of far-reaching changes in the nature of global security affairs. During the Cold War, the era in which contests between advanced industrial states dominated security affairs reached its apex. Bipolarity kept a lid on many civil wars between peoples. When it ended, these conflicts rose again to the surface, not just in the Balkans, but across Africa, the Middle East, and in Asia.<br><br>

In the world of ideas the dismantling 脱掉衣服 of the Wall also marked the end of old conflicts and the beginning of new ones. It was the death knell 丧钟 of Marxism-Communism and therefore the termination of the central intellectual contest of 20th century European politics.<br><br>

Yet 20 years later it is still uncertain whether Communism’s defeat also meant definitive victory for liberal democracy. In the last two decades, from Russia to China to Venezuela 委内瑞拉, democratic processes have proven susceptible to autocratic 专制 impulses 冲动. Liberal democracy now is forced to compete with new brands of neo-nationalist 民族主义 authoritarianism 独裁 in these places, and at the same time struggle against the universalist 普救 fundamentalism 原教旨主义 that energizes groups like Al Qa’ida 基地.<br><br>

Meanwhile, dissolution 解体 of the Soviet Union accelerated the nascent 初期 process of globalization, unleashing the productive potential of societies across the world and ushering in a new era in the history of free-market capitalism. But these dynamic new forces have proven susceptible to the same crises that have marked the history of free-market capitalism since the 19th century (and of which, ironically, Marx first forewarned 预警).<br><br>
<a href= "pic08.html">Flat 3.0 Tribal Globalization</a><br><br>
No surprise then, that we see nostalgia 怀旧 for the days before the Wall fell, when all seemed orderly and predictable. Even today’s nuclear challenges can lead to reconsideration of the improbable upsides of the bipolar “balance of terror” and “mutual assured destruction.” In retrospect, it is self-evident that the events of 1989 meant neither the end of history, nor the end of conflict. But they did mean the end of an era whose successor is still taking form.

A World Without Islam <br><br>  
Graham E. Fuller<br><br>

因素分析法/RAND<br><br>
What if Islam had never existed? To some, it's a comforting thought: No clash of civilizations, no holy wars, no terrorists. Would Christianity have taken over the world? Would the Middle East be a peaceful beacon of democracy? Would 9/11 have happened? In fact, remove Islam from the path of history, and the world ends up exactly where it is today.<br><br>

Graham E. Fuller is an American author and political analyst, specializing in Islamic extremism. Formerly vice-chair of the National Intelligence Council, he also served as Station Chief in Kabul for the CIA. A "think piece" that Fuller wrote for the CIA was identified as instrumental in leading to the Iran-contra affair. After a career in the United States State Department and CIA （中情局） lasting 27 years, he joined Rand （兰德） Corporation as senior political scientist specializing in the Middle East. As of 2006, he was affiliated with the Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada as an adjunct professor of history. He is the author of a number of books, including The Future of Political Islam.<br><br>

马明心离开了撒拉族地区后，该教派仍在撒拉族中继续传播。到乾隆三十四年（1769年），清廷又以高压手段封闭了新教（哲合忍耶）3座寺院，并将马明心的学生、循化地区新教首领贺麻路乎刑杖后，披枷发往新疆乌鲁木齐为奴。这些措施，加深和扩大了新老两个教派之间的矛盾，促使新教群众和清朝统治者之间的矛盾激化起来，加速了哲合忍耶教派的反清斗争。<br><br>
乾隆四十六年（1781年）三月初，两个教派终于爆发了大规模的械斗。先是马明心在撒拉族地区的得力弟子苏四十三（尕苏阿訇）和韩二哥（循化人，家有资财，有权势）率其信徒千余袭击了老教村庄，杀死教徒百余人，裹胁部分人随教，迫使许多人外出逃亡。随后老教告到陕甘总督衙门。总督勒尔谨委派兰州知府杨士玑，会同河州协副将新柱、皋司福菘等，带兵丁40余名赴撒拉族地区查办。新教群众听说，假装成老教信徒，抢先出迎，借以探听官府旨意。杨士玑等以为他们是老教，便表态说，官府要为老教作主，如新教不守法令，将尽洗之。苏四十三、韩二哥等听了清政府官员的这些言论后，大为愤激，遂决心率部暴动。是日晚杀死新柱，次日晨赶往旗台堡斩了杨士玑，夺取了大量军械和马匹，乘胜攻占河州（即今甘肃临夏）城，杀死知州、都司等官吏。这时正值连年灾荒，加以清政府又连年发动征服少数民族的战争，战祸频仍，赋税繁重，广大劳动人民对清政府恨之入骨，民族矛盾和阶级矛盾极其尖锐，原为哲合忍耶和老教之间的教派斗争，很快便转变成了以哲合忍耶教徒为主并包括若干其他教派的撒拉族和回族、东乡族等农民的联合反清暴动。<br><br>


清总督勒尔谨闻讯后，一面调西宁镇副将贡楚克连尔由循化截住归路，并派循化文武官吏率兵赴河州镇压；一面将马明心逮捕，由官川解押兰州。苏四十三和马明心的义女赛利麦（撒拉族人）等闻马明心被捕，遂率男女教徒2000余人攻陷河州城后，由小路经唐汪川，夜渡洮河，兼程进逼兰州，要求释放马明心，扬言如不释放，即攻打兰州城。时起义军士气正盛。兰州只有清标兵800名，城中空虚。布政使王廷瓒大为惊恐，无奈之下，便迫令马明心登城，劝谕苏四十三等退兵。苏四十三等见马明心后，跪地泣不成声，口称“圣人”不止，马明心见此情况，乃劝其退兵。由于苏四十三等不解马明心的意思，仍围城不走，于是马明心将手杖扔下城去，众人得此，如获至宝，抢着抚摩，互相传递。王廷瓒等见此，认为放了马明心回去，必将酿成更大变乱，随即杀害了马明心，同时散布谣言说十日后释放马明心，并将马明心的随从先行释放从而麻痹义军，等待援兵（如在城上杀害即无有后话）终年63岁，时间为乾隆四十六年（1781年）三月二十七日。<br><br>


马明心既殁，苏等反清之心更坚。清军怕受义军袭击，每夜经常鸣枪放炮，自相惊扰。清政府为了镇压义军，四下调兵“围剿”，派大学士何柱带京师健锐营、火器营兵2000赴援，先后派阿桂、和|、马彪、伍弥泰等人率兵万余进剿。义军十分勇敢，赛利麦率女兵与清军对阵时，一仗即杀死清将官9人，她与丈夫在阵上将人头亲自割下，挑竿示众，清军震恐，但终因众寡悬殊，义军不支，赛利麦同丈夫一并阵亡。苏四十三等被迫退守华林山后，坚持战斗3个月之久。四月十九日，图钦保率游击王三杰等仰攻华林山，撤拉族利用有利地形，大败清兵，打死清军990人，图钦保、王三杰等也被打死。勒尔谨因“师久无功”被革职，和|被调回。后清政府又派大兵“围剿”，并施用“以夷制夷”的办法，令撒拉族土司韩煜率众打先锋；又调四川金川屯藏兵千名和阿拉善旗蒙古兵七百“助剿”，围困华林山，断绝山上水源，将华林山清真寺的房屋尽行烧毁，撒拉族义军死伤400余人。六月初，清军乘大雨进攻，苏四十三等在寡不敌众的情况下，血战而死，起义军全部壮烈牺牲，无一降者。这次起义，就这样失败了。<br><br>
起义失败后，清统治者对起义军家属和新教群众采取了“斩绝根株”的野蛮政策，将安定、河州、官川、唐汪川、洪济桥等地许多人杀害，许多人被充军伊犁或云南。此外，清政府还颁布禁令，限制宗教活动，不准人民互相往来，不许留外来的回民学经、教经及居住；当地的回民也不得聚集寺内念经，回民不得复称掌教、阿訇等。为了加强控制，防止反抗事件再起，把陕、甘地区的军事重新作了部署，即在循化厅改驻参将一员，加强武力震慑；把提督府由西安迁到固原，把总兵由固原迁到河州。<br><br>
马明心在押期间，因受刑两腮胡须被拔掉，此后教徒为了表示纪念，便永远不留腮须，这是哲合忍耶教派在留须形式上异于其他教派的原因。马明心殉难后，据说尸体先埋于衙内马厩中，以后又移埋于兰州西门外之龙家滩。衙门中有一回民班长石某，继又从龙家滩将尸体偷挖出来，葬于东稍门外石家荣。嗣后于清光绪末年建“拱北”于该处。民国2年（1913年）又重修。1958年迁葬于兰州北山，后又迁桃树坪。原“拱北”墓地被兰州市东岗西路第二小学占用。1985年2月根据兰州市人民政府解决东稍门马明心墓地的决定，经有关部门同信教群众协商，将“拱北”墓地作了退还。<br><br>


西海固位于中国西部宁夏回族自治区南部的地带，是黄土丘陵区的西吉、海原、固原、彭阳、同心等七个国家级贫困县的统称，1972年被联合国粮食开发署确定为最不适宜人类生存的地区之一。<br><br>

今人张承志在其《大陆与情感》一书的《离别西海固》章节中这样说：“西海固，若不是因为我，有谁知道你千山万壑的旱渴荒凉，有谁知道你刚烈苦难的内里？西海固，若不是因为你，我怎么可能完成蜕变，我怎么可能冲决寄生的学术和虚伪的文章；若不是因为你这约束之地，我怎么可能终于找到了这一滴水般渺小而纯真的意义？”<br><br>

清真大美，沿黄河遍布的回商<br><br>

唐荣尧<br><br>
 　　如今很多去洛阳的游客，前往龙门石窟游玩时，会途经一个叫关林的地方。1970年6月，在洛阳关林18号唐墓出土了一件玻璃瓶，专家们经过考证后认为，这件玻璃瓶是阿拉伯人带到黄河流域的。它与西安何家村窖藏出土的圈纹玻璃碗一样，是当时的阿拉伯人远道而来时随身带来的。这些玻璃制品在当时的唐朝上层生活圈属于奢侈品。<br><br>
 　　那些不断带给大唐帝国上层社会奢侈品的阿拉伯人、波斯人，不再将其贸易的足迹沿着丝绸之路、大运河铺开了，他们的足迹开始沿着黄河铺开，使黄河流域逐渐有了越来越多的阿拉伯人、波斯人。带着虔敬的宗教信仰、带着善于经商的传统在黄河流域乃至中国大地上行走，他们聚居的地区逐渐出现越来越多的清真寺，这不仅成了他们生活区的标志，更是他们解决内部争端、协调族内事宜、沟通各种信息、传授其伊斯兰文明的重要载体。如今，从黄河上游的青海贵德县到入海口的山东东营市，清真寺蔓延在沿黄河的城市和村镇中，或是闹市深处或是田野之侧，黄河边的穆斯林们礼拜的背影和诵经声穿梭和萦绕在清真寺四周。<br><br>
 　　回族在黄河上游第一个较为集中的地区是兰州，几十座大小不一的清真寺掩隐在高大的城市建筑中，就如几百年来那些低声念诵的《古兰经》之声掩隐在这个城市的各种声音中一样。从兰州沿黄河而下，黄河边回族较为集中的第二个地区是宁夏的吴忠市，第三个集中区域是郑州的回民区。<br><br>
 　　早在伊斯兰教创始时期的阿拉伯半岛时期，阿拉伯穆斯林就认为商业是真主最喜爱的产业之一，认为从事商业活动是对真主的虔诚表达。那些从阿拉伯、波斯而来的穆斯林们更是善于经商，他们选择从丝绸之路或海洋之路来到中国，在高原、雪山、戈壁、大漠中回荡的驼铃声中，留下他们经商的影子；或者在一片片张开的风帆下面，随着一船船货物踏上中国的疆土，在沿海城市开展贸易。
 　　南宋朝因为偏离了中原农耕区和贸易区，其财政主要依靠阿拉伯、波斯商人的海外贸易；元代时期，穆斯林商人再次在驼铃声中开通丝绸之路上的贸易，也利用中国先进的造船技术完成数量越来越大的海上贸易。大多数阿拉伯、波斯商人成为扬州、泉州、杭州等商业城市繁荣的经济助推力量。那些从陆路进入的大批穆斯林们，逐渐散居内地，黄河流域便利的陆路、水路条件，更是那些善于经商的穆斯林的首选。<br><br>
 　　与徽商和晋商的经商心理相比，带着伊斯兰文明中重视经商传统的回族先民，没有受“父母在，不远游”的儒家思想约束，没有受传统社会“重农抑商”观念的约束，他们的血液里流淌着阿拉伯人善于经商的天性。在忽视商业经营的中国大地上，他们的天赋得到了充分发挥。<br><br>
 　　在黄河上游生活的回族，开辟着以兰州到包头的黄河水运和沿黄河两岸的陆路为经纬的商贸网络，逐渐使“回商”成为黄河上游商贸集群中的一支主力。他们的身影长期活跃在黄河边，形成了很多的回民聚居区和商贸区。比如兰州的小西湖一带的回民集中生活区、塞上回乡的吴忠市利通区、郑州和开封等城市的回民区等，他们利用黄河水运和陆上运输，不仅开辟了一座座黄河边的商贸码头和集镇，甚至开创了海外贸易，无论是青海的皮毛、甘肃的药材，还是宁夏枸杞、甘草，经过这些回商之手，向全国辐散或通过港口走出国门进行海外贸易。<br><br>
 　　清晨出现在黄河水面上的筏影，黄昏走进一个个客栈的驼声；逆沙而行的驼队出现在西北地区，收购着西北土产；顺水而下的筏阵，将驼队收购的宁夏平原、西北地区的特产运往水声远处的包头，然后通过火车运往天津，接着散通于中国各地或远销于世界各地，这是黄河上游的回商给民国时期的中国经济绘就的一幅真实画图。<br><br>
 　　一直注重经商的回回人来到宁夏平原后，很快发挥了他们的经商传统。吴忠是连接宁夏南北的咽喉之地，有西北旱码头之誉，善于经商的回回人逐渐聚集在这里，使这里慢慢发展成了西北重要的商品集散地。民国时期，大批回商的聚居和发展，出现了商品聚集地和商号，使这里成了宁夏的“华尔街”。<br><br>
 　　民国时期，吴忠街上的回族商号不仅成为吴忠地方经济的支柱，甚至一度成为影响宁夏经济的晴雨表。由回商何义江在吴忠开办的“聚源恒”商号，生意范围辐射到天津、西安、包头、西宁等地；马振邦的“振兴永”商号、马月坡的“福兴奎”商号等八大商号，成为业绩和声誉遍及西北地区的吴忠回商代表。他们负责将西北地区的土特产收购后运往全国各地，甚至出口到日本和西欧国家，同时也将当时先进的生活用品、生活理念输入到西北地区，使吴忠成为1920年至1940年这一时期的宁夏商业中心，中外货物在这里完成周转，大量看不见的资金在悄然运作中影响着宁夏的经济。<br><br>
 　　万历《歙书》中将徽商的经营方式归纳为五种：走贩、囤积、开张、质剂、回易。其中走贩这种长途贩运方式占据了相当重要的位置。回商同样将走贩放在赢利的第一步，而且是极其重要的步骤，以黄河边的吴忠回商为例，他们收购货物的来源主要有四个方向：通过驼运完成从北边的内蒙古阿拉善地区、西边的甘肃河西走廊地区和南边的宁夏南部山区，甚至更远的甘肃陇中、陕西关中地区、东边的陇东地区、陕北地区等地的货物采购；从青海西宁、甘肃兰州收购的货物，经由吴忠到内蒙古包头之间1500多公里黄河水面上的运输，则由羊皮、牛皮筏子完成；那些从南、北、西三个方向聚积在吴忠的货物，出售的主要地区则是内蒙古包头。在那里，这些货物通上火车抵达北京或天津，在北京囤积后走进各地，在天津出港后，走向海外。<br><br>
 　　除了黄河航运外，还有沿河而行的驼队，叮咚作响的驼铃就这样响在了黄河之滨经由鄂尔多斯西部高原抵达河套重镇包头的路段，无论是春寒料峭的一地积雪中，还是秋高气爽后的霜雾弥漫中，回商的驼队就这样在春秋季节穿梭在这条路段上，而为了收购货物，回商的驼队更是南下穿越六盘山，在关陇文化圈影响的陇中、关中一带出现，北上穿越贺兰山进入茫茫阿拉善戈壁大漠中，西渡黄河抵达祁连山下的河西走廊地区，甚至更远的青海高原上。悠扬的驼铃就这样响彻在城镇、戈壁、草原、河谷、沙漠等地区，也响彻在20世纪前期西北回商的记忆里。<br><br>

   
宁夏位于“丝绸之路”上，历史上曾是东西部交通贸易的重要通道，作为黄河流经的地区，这里同样有古老悠久的黄河文明。早在三万年前，宁夏就已有了人类生息的痕迹，公元1028年，党项族的首领李元昊在此建立了西夏王朝，并形成了独特的西夏文化。<br><br>

根据《宁夏回族自治区2010年第六次全国人口普查主要数据公报》，全区常住人口为6,301,350人。其中，男性人口为3,228,812人，占51.24 %；女性人口为3,072,538人，占48.76%。总人口性别比（以女性为100，男性对女性的比例）为105.09；0-14岁人口为1,353,743人,占21.48%；15-64岁人口为4,543,690人，占72.11%；65岁及以上人口为403,917人，占6.41%；汉族人口为4,069,412人，占64.58%；各少数民族人口为 2,231,938人，占35.42%，其中回族人口为2,190,979人，占34.77%；具有大学（指大专以上）程度的人口为576,702人；具有高中（含中专）程度的人口为784,596人。<br><br>

新疆维吾尔自治区，简称“新疆”，辖区古称西域。新疆自古以来就是中国不可分割的一部分，公元前60年，西汉设西域都护府，东汉魏晋改都护为长史，唐代设伊、西、庭三州和安西州北庭两个都护府17世纪中叶以后清朝平定了准噶尔部叛乱在天山南北设伊犁将军光绪10年（1884年）清政府在新疆设省，意为“故土新归”。新疆维吾尔自治区地处亚欧大陆腹地，位于中国西北边疆，面积166万平方公里，约占国土总面积的六分之一，是中国陆地面积最大的省级行政区。陆地边境线5600多公里。历史上是古丝绸之路的重要通道，现在又成为第二座“亚欧大陆桥”的必经之地。1949年新疆和平解放，1955年10月1日成立新疆维吾尔自治区。截止2004年底，新疆人口为1963.11万人，其中少数民族人口约占60.5%。新疆的少数民族有维吾尔族、哈萨克族、回族、柯尔克孜族、蒙古族、塔吉克族、锡伯族、满族、乌孜别克族、俄罗斯族、达斡尔族、塔塔尔族等。<br><br>

（德国之声中文网）这一在2010年进行的调研还显示，伊斯兰和印度教将成为未来成长速度最快的宗教，而与此同时，犹太教则趋于衰微之势。周二，美国皮尤宗教与公众生活论坛公布了这个名为"全球宗教形势图"的调研报告。<br><br>

从地域而言，基督教在全球各地传播，而印度教的94%的信徒集中生活在一个国家- 印度。

16%的世界人口说自己没有宗教信仰，全球69亿人口中，有84%信仰某一种宗教。"没有宗教属性"栏目包括的那些人中，有的虽没有宗教信仰，但却信奉某种神灵。该调研报告写道，"在中国，所谓没有宗教信仰的公民中，有7%却信某种神灵或者某种超自然的力量，这个数字在法国是30%，美国68%。"<br><br>

伊斯兰在扩张<br><br>

信仰宗教的确切人数很难精确的调查，它的规模只能估计，尤其在几大宗教的人口调查上，有时数据的偏差能够上亿。皮尤论坛推出的这份报告是迄今收集数据最广泛的调研之一。<br><br>

皮尤论坛的人口学专家哈克特（Conrad Hackett）说，这一报告总结了2500项统计、询问以及人口普查的结果，但它并没有带来进一步的突破，还不能精确估测无神论者的人数。他说，"它不能套用到每个国家。"<br><br>

调研指出，穆斯林人口的平均年龄是23岁，而全球宗教信徒的平均年龄是28岁。哈克特说，"作为世界人口的一部分，穆斯林人数在增加，它也是年轻人口结构的重要组成部分。"<br><br>

犹太教发展前景黯淡<br><br>

作为对比，犹太教拥有信众1400万，占世界人口的0.2%，教徒的平均年龄是36岁，是所有宗教中发展前景最暗淡的。哈克特指出，全球犹太教信徒的40.5%生活在以色列，那里犹太人的年龄结构低于美国的犹太人。全球41%的犹太人生活在美国。基督教徒的全球平均年龄是30，印度教是26岁。该调研显示，无信仰人群的发展前景也不看好，他们的平均年龄是34岁。<br><br>

基督教人口最多<br><br>

调研作出的估测是，基督教是目前最大的宗教，拥有22亿信众，占世界人口的31.1%，这中间包括罗马天主教和福音派新教，前者的信众超过11亿，占基督教人口的50%以上，接下来是占37%的新教和12%的东正教。<br><br>

全球穆斯林人口大约有16亿，占世界人口的23%。调研报告指出，"其中的绝大部分（87%至90%）是逊尼派，10%至13%是什叶派。"<br><br>

不信仰任何一个宗教的人口大约是11亿，其中62%生活在中国。52.2%的中国人口不信仰宗教。<br><br>

日本是另一个不信仰宗教人口占多数的国家，大约57%的日本人不信仰宗教。接下来是美国，那里16.4%的人口认为自己不信仰任何一种宗教。<br><br>

印度教集中在印度、尼泊尔和孟加拉国。全球佛教徒的一半生活在中国，然后是泰国（13.2%）、日本（9.4%）。<br><br>
