PREFACE<br><br>

Since WWII, U.S. military successes have depended on air superiority and air dominance 制空权. Successive generations of fighters have wrestled air superiority from each adversary in turn, enabling every other use of airpower, and indeed, military power in general. The last American killed by a foreign aircraft died in 1953,1 and U.S. air superiority has enabled every other airpower capability C ISR, C2, interdiction 封锁, strike 打击, close air support, etc. U.S. air superiority has also given land and naval forces unprecedented flexibility and security. U.S. warfighting has evolved with air dominance as an assumption, enabling positioning of overwhelming forces at large, secure bases and staging areas.<br><br>

There is a distinct possibility that this assumption might fail in a vital theater of interest C the western Pacific. Chinese military modernization has proceeded rapidly, giving the PLA a formidable array of modern weaponry, including advanced 4th-generation fighters, the latest integrated air defenses, and a huge arsenal of conventional ballistic missiles. Chinese military modernization has focused on finding an “indirect approach” to blunt or neutralize the hallmark of U.S. military power, airpower. This report examines whether such efforts may prove successful, and if so, the extent to which U.S. airpower suffers in a notional Taiwan air defense scenario. This dissertation examines the risk of U.S.-China conflict based on a variety of theoretical works on conflict, applied to the U.S.-China relationship. Following this examination, and finding that the U.S.- China relationship does include elements of risk, the dissertation examines the implications of anti-access weapons on USAF sortie generation. The dissertation develops a simple sortie-generation model and air combat framework, using open-source data to estimate the forces that the USAF and the PLAAF can bring to bear, and predicts the results of air combat between two forces of dissimilar performance and quantity. Finally the dissertation examines options for increasing USAF performance in the face of antiaccess weapons, which includes a methodology to assess the effectiveness of strike employed to achieve air superiority.<br><br>

This dissertation includes assumptions and omissions intended to focus its scope. These limitations are fully caveated in the introduction, in the conclusions, and as they occur throughout the dissertation. This research should be of interest to anyone involved with defense policy regarding USAF modernization and force structures or defense policy regarding the U.S. security posture in the western Pacific.<br><br>

Why ought we care about the possibility of war in the western Pacific, especially at a time when tensions seem to be easing and the United States is engaged in two enduring irregular wars? In short, war may not be likely in the immediate future, but there is still risk. Further, war does not seem likely in large part because of the U.S. conventional deterrent. But if this deterrent were eroded by Chinese antiaccess efforts and U.S. complacency, conflict becomes more likely and averting conflict engenders more costly losses of power and prestige. Without a strong U.S. military presence, the western Pacific would be more dangerous.<br><br>

美国研究中国，中国研究美国，要知己知彼。理解美国，首先是美国人，Steve Jobs就是典型。读者可以看1985年<a href= "link05.html">Playboy Interview: Steven Jobs </a>、1995  The Lost Interview以及 2005 Stanford Commencement address。比较三章，你可以看到一个美国人的成长发展。<br><br>

Despite encouraging signs, the U.S.-China relationship remains risky. This work examined two international security perspectives on conflict generation to determine whether or not there is risk of war in the U.S.-China relationship. The hegemonic change perspective documents situations where rising states challenge the hegemon for control of the international system, often violently. While the U.S.-China relationship is roughly congruent with this explanation, the current open, multi-lateral, and liberal world order may make power shifts less violent in the future.<br><br>




Empirical studies of conflict also expose some concerning elements in the U.S.-China relationship: a shift in relative power, China’s growth in power, a rough balance in national capability, the tactical advantage China enjoys in the western Pacific, and, in the future, the possibility for democratization in China. Only the large trade magnitude between the two states is encouraging. <br><br>


Whatever the macro trends that make conflict more or less likely, wars still require catalysts. The most likely catalyst in this case is the lingering uncertainty over the status of Taiwan. The Taiwan problem features two armed camps with almost mutually exclusive goals. In addition, the governments in Beijing and Taipei generally have trouble communicating, which raises the risk that an otherwise manageable crisis could become something much worse. If there is U.S.-China conflict, Taiwan is the most likely flashpoint.<br><br>




Preventing a U.S.-China-Taiwan war is both a diplomatic and a military endeavor. In order to help China and Taiwan to resolve differences peacefully, all parties should to take steps to encourage and enhance cross-straits dialog and cooperation. In addition, incorporating China into strong, multilateral institutions will give China a presence in the international system commensurate with its growing hard power, and give China an attractive alternative to brandishing that hard power.<br><br>




This is not to say, however, that military preparation for a U.S.- China-Taiwan conflict is moot: diplomacy works best when words are backed by military force. While engaging China, the United States needs to hedge by enhancing its capability to defend Taiwan. A strong military capability would lend credibility to diplomatic negotiations, and should continue to tilt China’s cost-benefit calculation towards the peaceful resolution of differences. Ideally the use of force will not be necessary; but the availability of credible military options would help ensure that those military options will never be used. We may be tempted to draw the conclusion that, given that such a conflict would be so difficult to win, the United States should begin to back away from its commitment to Taiwan. However, there would be very serious repercussions from abrogating our regional commitments, repercussions that may be as bad as fighting and failing to win a U.S.- China-Taiwan conflict.<br><br>




U.S. allies in the area would doubt the strength of the U.S. commitment to them, and we could see large-scale defection. Japan, unwilling to leave regional hegemony to China, might choose to bolster its own military C perhaps by developing nuclear weapons. The region could become very dangerous. Beyond the effect on U.S. allies, if the United States cannot fulfill its commitment to Taiwan in the future, the United States would have essentially ceded regional hegemony to China. This would be a severe blow to U.S. power and prestige. In the long run, some adjustment in regional power between the United States and China may be inevitable anyway. If this is the case, it would be better if the United States could make transition arrangements on its own terms, and at least leave in place a security architecture that would shape the region in a peaceful direction. However, the abrupt departure of U.S. power from the region would leave a dangerous power vacuum. If the United States does nothing to bolster its capabilities to defend Taiwan, or actively retreats from defending Taiwan, the strategic repercussions would be severe.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T3">CONCLUSIONS</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
Geography and China’s anti-access threats make a scenario where the USAF only operates from Andersen AFB very  ossible. In this case, the USAF would find it very difficult to project power, and a PLAAF CONOP using superior  umbers to raid vulnerable USAF aircraft could displace U.S. airpower in the western Pacific.<br><br>


The discussion and analysis in this work show that this conflict, if it were to occur, would be much harder to win and would be much more costly to the United States than other recent conventional conflicts. In fact, winning would not a foregone conclusion C as has been the case in all conventional conflicts since the end of the Cold War. Further, if U.S. leadership dismisses or ignores the threats to regional airbases, not only could the United States fail to win this particular conflict, but the United States could lose the greater portion of its airpower in the process.<br><br>

Avoiding the scenario will require more than faith that China will not use its ballistic missile force, will require more than the F-22 (as good as it is), and will require more than a complacency that a conflict over Taiwan will never happen. While the U.S.-China relationship seems stable at the moment, there is yet some risk, and the U.S. military exists to prepare for wars that hopefully never occur, thereby preventing them. Responding to PLA modernization, especially antiaccess capabilities, will require creative solutions on the part of the USAF and U.S. military as a whole.<br><br>
